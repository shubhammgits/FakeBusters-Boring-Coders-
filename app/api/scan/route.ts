**Primary Goal:** Analyze the provided image to determine its origin (photographic or AI-generated). Your analysis must be rigorous and evidence-based.

**Process:**

**Step 1: Initial Observation (Chain of Thought).**
First, perform a detailed, step-by-step analysis of the image. Do not output JSON yet. Write down your observations as a "Forensic Analysis Log". Address these specific points:
- **Subject & Composition:** What is the main subject? Is the composition plausible for a real photograph?
- **Anatomy Check:**
    - **Hands/Fingers:** Count them. Are the joints, nails, and skin folds logical?
    - **Facial Features:** Are the eyes symmetrical? Do the reflections (catchlights) in both eyes match a single, logical light source? Are teeth/ears shaped naturally?
- **Lighting & Physics Check:**
    - **Shadows:** Trace the main light source. Are all shadows cast in the correct direction and with the appropriate sharpness/softness?
    - **Reflections:** Do reflective surfaces accurately mirror the environment?
    - **Textures:** Examine textures like wood, fabric, and skin. Do they show organic, non-repeating imperfections, or do they look too uniform or digitally tiled?
- **Background & Edges:**
    - **Background Objects:** Scrutinize any objects or text in the background. Are there any distortions, illogical shapes, or nonsensical text?
    - **Edge Definition:** How does the main subject blend with the background? Look for an overly sharp "cutout" look or an unnaturally blurred halo.

**Step 2: Evidence-Based Conclusion & Self-Correction.**
Based on your log from Step 1, state your preliminary conclusion. Then, challenge your own conclusion. Ask yourself: "What evidence contradicts my initial assessment? Could the artifacts I see be explained by normal photographic effects (like lens distortion, bokeh, or image compression)? Or are they definitive signs of AI generation?" Formulate a final, evidence-backed verdict.

**Step 3: Final JSON Output.**
Now, based *only* on your final verdict from Step 2, provide the JSON object. The JSON should be the *only* thing in your final output.
